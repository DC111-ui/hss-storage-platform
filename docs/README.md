## Migration note

The project direction has changed from a WordPress-based implementation to a custom UI + API architecture.

Legacy WordPress assets are kept in `wordpress/` for reference only and are no longer the target runtime for new development.

## Next implementation steps

1. Build backend booking API and persistence layer.
2. Connect `ui/` form submission to backend endpoints.
3. Add admin dashboard views for capacity and booking management.
4. Introduce authentication and role-based access.
